# Tokenized Property Ownership

## Project Title
Tokenized Property Ownership

## Project Description
Tokenized Property Ownership is a Soroban-based smart contract platform that enables fractional ownership of real estate and property assets on the Stellar blockchain. The system allows property owners to tokenize their assets by dividing them into shares that can be purchased by investors, creating a decentralized marketplace for real estate investment.

This platform bridges the gap between traditional real estate ownership and blockchain technology, making property investment more accessible and liquid. By representing property ownership as digital shares on the blockchain, the system enables fractional investment, transparent ownership records, and streamlined property transactions without the traditional barriers of real estate investment.

## Project Vision
The vision for Tokenized Property Ownership is to democratize access to real estate investment by breaking down barriers of entry and creating new opportunities for fractional ownership. By tokenizing property assets, we aim to transform real estate from an illiquid, high-threshold investment class into a flexible, accessible market where investors of all sizes can participate.

Our goal is to build a transparent, efficient, and inclusive property investment ecosystem that leverages blockchain technology to solve traditional real estate challenges including high entry costs, illiquidity, complex transactions, and geographical limitations. We envision a future where property ownership is as seamless as stock ownership, where assets can be traded easily, and where verification of ownership is immutable and transparent.
